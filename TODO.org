#+STARTUP: content

* Documentation
** TODO Completion
   Document Eshell completion.

** TODO Built-in variables
   This appears to be complete, but check the source for any unmentioned
   variables.

** TODO "Input/Output" chapter
   Document redirection.

** TODO "Extension modules" chapter
   - [X] Find out from johnw what this should cover.
   ~<johnw> aidalgol: check out em-banner.el~

** TODO "Extras and Goodies" chapter
   This should be removed until the manual is finished and there are any
   miscellaneous topics left undocumented.

* Code
** TODO Fix =eshell/kill=
   Add ability to kill non-process objects to match the documentation, and
   update the documentation to describe usage in more detail.

** TODO Remove predicate reference
   Remove the functions =eshell-display-predicate-help= and
   =eshell-display-predicate-help= and their associated variables, since this is
   already better documented in the Zsh manual.  See [["Predicates"%20section][the corresponding TODO item
   for the documentation]].

   The chapter "Expansion" covers behaviour implemented in three Eshell modules:
   esh-var, em-glob, and em-pred.  em-pred is the only one of these to have a
   syntax reference accessible via commands.  The syntax can be changed by the
   user, possibly making this reference incorrect or incomplete because it is
   hard-coded into the source code, so I think this should be removed,
   especially as the syntax is already documented more fully in the Zsh manual.

** TODO Angle brackets
   Figure out what angle brackets mean in Eshell.  See lines 37-39 of
   ~esh-var.el~.  They seem to be a half-baked implementation of Bash's =<()=
   behaviour.

** TODO =su= and =sudo= problems
   Determine the cause of the erratic behaviour of the =su= and =sudo= commands
   that keeps coming up in ~#emacs~.

** TODO Bug squashing
   Squash any easy bugs mentioned at the end of the manual.
